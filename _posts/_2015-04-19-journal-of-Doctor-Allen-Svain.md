Now that those fools with their hand held guns have left, who hold a gun in their hand these days?, with the invention of my Head-mounted Attack Tool (HAT) you can fire at anyone foolish to approach...anyway where was I? Oh yes the "bomb" which had all of those cretins so worried on that train.  After closely analyzing the device in this wretched inn, of course someone with my abilities deserves a lab of their own or perhaps a full professorship in the Imperial University, I have determined that someone attempted to create an explosive by including crushed bits of this "ghost rock" into the explosives.  I know the simpletons in this town would panic if I were to conduct a few controlled detonations with this sustenance and traditional dynamite but I still anticipate that this device while powerful would only increase the explosive yield by a small factor.  2 sticks of TNT for 1 stick of this Bound Object Makes Blasts (BOMB) .  The process to create this was obviously conducted by someone with minimal training, though the "ghost rock" is crushed in a uniform pattern the small quantity indicates that this process has a large amount of waste and could be improved if someone of my intellect was able to get his hands on the machine.  

By incorporating the principles of "ghost rock" engineering which I have discovered from investigating some of these crude object, monocle, pistol, bomb, into my design for the WORLD RENOWN SVAIN (Sublime Vehicle Advanced Intellect Needed to ride) .  "Ghost Rock" infused alloys could allow for more powerful combustion to take place within the engine, their power would be increased and the weight reduced allowing for more speed, that will show those fools back in the fatherland that they were ingoarmouses for ignoring my plans and I will belcomed as a hero as I ride the SVAIN right into the office of that wretched dean.

Now to return to that train, improve the SVAIN and take my rightful place amonst the scienfitic pantheon!!!

Also to find some sustenance

These instructions are for Faculty Senate (FS) and Professional Staff Senate (PSS) members to create their own Twitter.com account for use with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SharedGovernance&src=typd">#SharedGovernance</a>.  It is recommended that you sign up on a computer rather than a tablet/smartphone.  You will also need an email address, this will not be public. 

* Go to https://twitter.com/ and in the "New to Twitter?" box enter your name (public), email (not public) and create a secure password.

* On the next screen you will need to choose a nickname for your account.  This is how users will address you publically so you should choose something: relevant, professional, unique, and short.  Don't worry, you can change it later.

	* The "Tailor Twitter based on my recent website visits" check box refers to an opt-in advertising system.  It is similar to the way in which Google uses your search history to target you with ads related to these services.  

* Click next through the "Welcome" screen

* Next update your Twitter account with a 160 character bio as well as an image.  Changing your image from the default [Twitter Egg](/assets/acs2014/acs2014-twitter-egg.png) will help distinguish your account.  Many employer have a social media policy and adding a "Posts are my own" message can help comply with these policies.  Please check with your organization for a formal social media policy.
